Force is that which can change the state of rest or uniform motion of an object. Force is simply pushes
and pulls of one thing on another.
If a body is thrown up in the air, what is the effect of gravity on the body? At first gravity reduces the
speed of upward movement of the body and at a certain height it stops. So Force effects the speed.
Take a sponge and squeeze it will change its shape. 
Throw a ball at a person in one direction. That person will hit the ball again i.e. apply force to the ball
and it will change its direction.
To sum up the examples, the effects that occur when a force is applied to an object are:
1. The object may start to move or stop moving.
2. The object may speed up or slow down.
3. The object may change its shape
4. The object may change its direction of movement.
